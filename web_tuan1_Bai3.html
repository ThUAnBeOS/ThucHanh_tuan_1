        <p>One particular book which is recommended

            <br>This book is about a lawyer who begins re-
            <br>evaluating his priorities in life when a bad

            <br>and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless,
            <br>and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The</u>
